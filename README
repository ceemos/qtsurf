Qt surf - another simple webkit-based browser
=============================================
Qt surf is a simple Web browser based on Qt and QtWebkit. 

It is currently written in PyQt, since C++ is a pain to use. Reason for using 
Qt instead of GTK like surf [1] is stability: WebkitGTK tends to crash on heavy
websites, and GGTK3 makes it even worse. However, GTK3 is needed for touchscreen
support.

QtWebkit seems to render everything you throw at it, including WebGL and HTML5
video.

Requirements
------------
Qt surf needs Qt5 with QtWebkit and PyQt5. Tested with Python 2.

Caveats
-------
While Qt has support for touchscreens and tablets and kintetic scrolling, it
seems to be pretty broken. Qt surf uses lots of manual event handling to make
everything work.

Right now barely any features are implemented, but it should be quite easy to
port almost all features of surf [1].

In the future, it might be nice to migrate to native code, but for these early
stages I prefer Python. (You can remove the app.exec line and load it in ipython
to inspect APIs and try functions.)

Also in the future, Qt will migrate to QtWebEngine, which is chromium based. 
While it is probably heavier than Webkit, the code seems to be in a better 
shape, and it might even be possible to compile a static surf binary with it.
